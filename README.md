# Learning_Diary_Full_Stack

This is a full stack Learning Diary web app that utilizes a React frontend, a NodeJS backend connecting to a MongoDB database.
A deployed version of this is running at https://learningdiary.herokuapp.com/

To use it locally, you must create a MongoDB cluster and an .env file with a specific PORT and MONGODB_URI along with the necessary api key information to access the database.
